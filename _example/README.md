A simple implementation of the api gateway, server1, server2 and server3 examples.

To build:

```shell
go build api_gateway.go
go build server1.go
go build server2.go
go build server3.go
```

To run, open four terminals, and execute the following:

```shell
./api_gateway
./server1
./server2
./server3
```

To test:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/service1 -v
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/service2 -v
```

Header information is printed to stdout. You should see headers propagated from service to service.

On the API gateway:

```sh
